#Inheritance in Python:

Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child class) acquires the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent class)
It promotes code reusability, because the child class can use the code already written in the parent class.


#Types of inheritence
1.single inheritance:
    One parent → One child
    
2.multiple inheritance:
    One child inherits from more than one parent.
    Father    Mother
    \      /
      Child
    
3.multilevel inheritance:
    Inheritance in multiple levels.
4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
    One parent → Multiple children.
5. Hybrid Inheritance:
    A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
